As mentioned, my name is David Joseph Vasko. I am currently 23 years old and have a BS in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA and a MS in Aerospace Engineering also from UCLA. I also have passion for programming and would love to be able to us that passion in the workplace. I finished my Masters program this last June and am in to process of finding a job. Ideally, I will be able to get a job in either San Diego, or San Jose.

I am an avid surfer, rock climber and slacklner. I like to read fantasy and science fiction books, as well as watch anime. I love the piano and play for enjoyment.
