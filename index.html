My name is David Joseph Vasko. I am the sixth child and my first name starts with 'd', hence the name "vasko6d." The purpose of this site is to give me some practice using HTML and at the same time create a nice place to showcase things I think are important.
</p>
<p>
The projects presented in the professional tab are projects I was part of during my time at UCLA as a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate student, and Aerospace Engineering masters student. 
</p>
<p>
The crossword application in the "SacTown" tab is a personal project I made to compile all of my friends home-made crosswords in one place and provide an easy way to solve them, and not waste paper. Note that the crossword application does not currently work in Firefox. Tested in Current versions of Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.

<p> 
Anyway, take a look. Cheers.
